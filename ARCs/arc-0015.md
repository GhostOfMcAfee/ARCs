# Algorand Standard for Encrypted Short Messages 

## Abstract

Algorand public account addresses (Ed25519) can be converted to DH keys (Curve25519) suitable for encryption.  
A sender can use a converted public key to encrypt message contents. Transaction signature verification assures the message's authenticity. 
The recipient can decrypt the message successfully with a derivative of the Algorand private key associated with the public key used for encryption. 

## Specification

### Account's message Application

An application needs to be associated with an account to receive a message.
The application **MUST** follow the following convention:

- A Local State named `public_key` **MUST** contains a public account `Ed25519-Address`
  - If the account is a public account, it is **NOT RECOMMENDED** to use the account's Address as `public_key`.
- A Box `inbox` with:
  - Keys equal to the concatenation of the sender's address, and the round when the message was sent.
  > example: concat("UAME...RSRI", "_", "24518905")
  - Values are encoded messages
 


### Extensible message format

The payload of the messages is defined as UINT8Array MessagePack encoding of an **ALGOSMSV0_PAYLOAD** object. 

The **ALGOSMSV0_PAYLOAD** object contains, among other fields, an encrypted UINT8Array MessagePack encoding of **ALGOSMSV0_MESSAGE**.

#### Definitions

**ALGOSMSV0_TYPE_MESSAGE**: `algosms/v0:message`

**ALGOSMSV0_TYPE_MSG**: `algosms/v0:msg`

```ts
// UINT8Array ecrypted contents as msgpack encoded object
interface ALGOSMSV0_PAYLOAD {
  /** Object type eq to ALGOSMSV0_TYPE_MESSAGE * */
  t: string;

  /** one-time public key of the NACL's sealed box * */
  otPK: Uint8Array;

  /** cipherText of the ALGOSMSV0_MESSAGE structure * */
  cT: Uint8Array;
}
```

```ts
// UINT8Array ALGOSMSV0_MESSAGE contents as msgpack encoded object
interface ALGOSMSV0_MESSAGE {
  /** Object Type - eq to ALGOSMSV0_TYPE_MSG * */
  t: string;

  /** Short visible message contents in UTF-8 * */
  msg: string;

  /** Optional display name chosen by the sender, to be displayed along reverse Unstoppable/NF.domains * */
  from?: string;

  /** Optional reference (e.g. threadID, invoiceID, txnID) * */
  ref?: string;

  /** Optional URI (URL/URN/...) * */
  uri?: string;

  /** Optional JSON-encoded metadata * */
  meta?: string;

  /** Optional binary content * */
  bin?: Uint8Array;

  /** Optional random padding to hide original message length. * */
  pad?: Uint8Array;
}
```

### Message encryption (seal)

1. A message object of type ALGOSMSV0_MESSAGE is converted to MessagePack UINT8Array using algosdk.encodeObj implementation (**encMsg**)
2. Recipient public DH key is derived from the account's public key shown inside the recipient's Application (**rcptPubKey**) 
3. A static nonce is derived from the first 24 bytes of the sender address public key. (**nonce**)
4. An ephemeral DH key pair is generated (**otSecretKey**, **otPubKey**)
5. Encryption is done using `nacl.box(encMsg, nonce, rcptPubKey, otSecretKey)` library call.
6. A **payload** of type ALGOSMSV0_PAYLOAD is constructed as from resulting ciphertext (**cT**) , as well as **otPubKey** 
7. The final binary message contents are result of algosdk.encodeObj(**payload**)

### Messages decryption (unseal)
1.  A binary message in UINT8Array form is decoded to ALGOSMSV0_PAYLOAD object (**)
2.  A static nonce is derived from the first 24 bytes of the sender address public key. (**nonce**)
3.  An one-time encryption public key is copied from the first 32 bytes of cipherBufferWithOTPubKey (**otPublicKey**)
4.  A cipher buffer is copied from the rest of the payload (**cipherBuffer**)
5.  A recipient secret crypto key is derived from the private key of the Algorand account shown inside the recipient's Application (**rcptSecretKey**)
1. Message is decrypted by a call to `nacl.box.open(cipherBuffer, nonce, otPublicKey, rcptSecretKey)`
2. Message is decoded into the final JSON string with an UTF-8 decoder 

### Application behaviour
* Production message sending **MUST** be done on the *main-net*.
 * Application **SHOULD** pad the message with enough random characters to ensure that message content cannot be deduced by examining the length of the encrypted message.
 * A message **SHOULD NOT** be decrypted automatically by a Wallet. 
* A decryption fee **MAY** be collected by a Wallet for each decryption operation. 

### Security

* Message authenticity is assured by Algorand's L1
* The encryption scheme is a verbose version of NACL's sealed box.
	* A random, one-time, key pair is used for message encryption instead of sender's private key
	* Private keys of receiving party are only used to decrypt the message
* Amout of ciphertext padding is not mandated by this ARC

### Example TypeScript implementation

#### Example functions
```ts
const ALGOSMSV0_TYPE_MSG:string = 'algosms/v0:msg';
const ALGOSMSV0_TYPE_MESSAGE:string = 'algosms/v0:message';

/**
 * sealMessageIntoNote takes a message object, an Algorand addresses 
 * of message recipient and sender and returns PKI encrypted message.
 * Encrypted message is an UINT8Array as retured from algosdk.encodeObject() 
 * that should be used directly as message
 * 
 * @param message - a ALGOSMSV0_MESSAGE object with a message and other metadata

  //Add a random length pad of up to 16 bytes if one is missing
  if (!message.pad || message.pad.length === 0) {
    message.pad = nacl.randomBytes(Math.floor(Math.random() * 16));
  }

  //Let's use signing keys for encryption. :)
  const recipientPublicSignKey = algosdk.decodeAddress(recipientAlgoAddress).publicKey;

  //Convert recipient's public signing key to crypto key
  const rcptPubKey = ed2curve.convertPublicKey(recipientPublicSignKey);

  // We should not use our static private signing key for encryption. 
  // Also no need to prove I am the sender - it's done elsewhere. 
  // Let's use random KP and send the public part over the wire

## Rationale

Algorand blockchain unlocks many new use cases - anonymous user login to dApps and classical WEB2.0 solutions being one of them. For many use-cases, anonymous users still require asynchronous event notifications, and email seems to be the only standard option at the time of the creation of this ARC. With wallet adoption of this standard, users will enjoy real-time encrypted A2P (application-to-person) notifications without having to provide their email addresses and without any vendor lock-in. 

Another approach was to use note field for messages, but with box storage available, it was a more practical design.
